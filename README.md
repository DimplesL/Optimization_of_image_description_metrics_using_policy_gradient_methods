# Optimization of image description metrics using policy gradient methods
This is Tensorflow implement of paper: [Optimization of image description metrics using policy gradient methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00370).

## How to run the code
### Extract image features
Go into the `./inception` directory, the python script which used to extract features is: `extract_inception_bottleneck_feature.py`.

In this python script, there are few parameters you should modified:
 - `image_path`:
